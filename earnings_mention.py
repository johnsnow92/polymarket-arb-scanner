"""Earnings-mention NO-harvest out-of-sample (OOS) logger — detection only.

Re-runs the round-2 earnings-mention pilot out-of-sample on newly-settled Kalshi
company-KPI / earnings-mention markets to confirm the in-sample finding that
11-50c YES contracts are systematically ~10pts too rich at T-24h (R2-1: +10.3pts,
z=2.41, n=240). This module is a deterministic statistical logger: it finds
markets that have ALREADY settled, reconstructs each one's YES price at T-24h
before close from historical candlesticks, joins that to the realized
settlement, and computes a richness z-score. It places NO orders and involves
NO LLM in any path. See docs/plans/08-earnings-mention-oos.md.

Method note (redesign, 2026-07-05): v1 tried to snapshot markets LIVE while
they sat inside their open [close-24h, close-6h] window. That cannot reliably
catch a market whose entire lifetime falls between two weekly cron runs (e.g.
one that opens Tuesday and settles before the next Sunday run never gets
snapshotted at all) — a real coverage gap, not just a timing nuance. The
in-sample pilot never had this problem because it worked backwards from
settled markets via candlestick reconstruction (T1-pm-dispersion-novelty.md
§a: "T-24h/T-6h candle reconstruction"), which needs nothing to happen while
the market is still open. This module now does the same: look at what has
SETTLED since the last watermark, then fetch each one's T-24h price
after the fact. There is no "pending" snapshot state as a result — a market
is only ever touched once, after it has already resolved.

The client is duck-typed (any object exposing ``fetch_candlesticks``) so the
core logic is unit-testable without network, keys, or the live KalshiClient.
``fetch_settled_markets`` (the discovery step) is called directly by the
runner (scripts/run_earnings_mention_oos.py), which also owns the
watermark/seen-ticker bookkeeping — this module stays limited to the parts
that are pure or that need network only to answer one question (what was the
YES price at T-24h for this specific, already-settled market).
