"""Settlement Timing Arbitrage — Strategy #33.

Buy winning outcomes on slow-settling platforms before settlement propagates.

Different platforms settle events at different times after resolution:
- Polymarket: Usually within minutes to hours
- Kalshi: Same day or next business day
- Betfair/Smarkets: Within hours to 1 day

When Platform A settles and Platform B hasn't yet:
1. Platform A confirms the outcome (price → 1.0 or 0.0)
2. Platform B still trades at 0.97-0.99 for the winning outcome
3. Buy the winning side on Platform B at discount
4. Receive full payout when Platform B settles

Layer 2: Near-arbitrage — outcome is known but not yet settled everywhere.
