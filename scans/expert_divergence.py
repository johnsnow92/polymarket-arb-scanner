"""Expert Individual Forecaster Divergence — Strategy #40.

Trade when superforecaster predictions diverge from market prices.

Superforecasters have historically outperformed prediction markets
on certain question types. When their forecasts diverge significantly
from market prices, there may be alpha in betting on convergence.

Sources:
- Good Judgment Open (superforecaster track)
- INFER (intelligence community forecasters)
- Metaculus (community + expert forecasters)

Layer 4: Informed trading — directional bet based on expert edge.
