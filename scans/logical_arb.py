"""Combinatorial logical arbitrage detection across related Polymarket markets.

Detects semantic inconsistencies where implied outcomes are priced significantly
lower than the implying outcomes. E.g., "Bitcoin >$100k" implies "Bitcoin >$90k",
so if P(>$100k) > P(>$90k), there's an arbitrage opportunity.

Uses config-driven semantic rules in JSON format to identify related market pairs.
Two-stage detection: Stage 1 scans mid-price candidates, Stage 2 refines with CLOB.
