"""Unified cross-engine P&L ledger — aggregation core (data-layer integration).

The portfolio integrates ONLY at the data layer: every fill/period across every
engine (arbgrid, quant-engine, ...) lands in one shared ``pnl`` table tagged with
``engine``, ``lane``, and ``tax_bucket``. This is the pure roll-up the daily
digest renders and the day-90 review consolidates: P&L by engine, by lane, and
by tax bucket — plus the capital-policy hurdle check (did a lane beat the 4.70%
LOC floor, or should its capital go to the LOC instead?).

Tax buckets are fixed (the three-bucket model): ``ordinary``, ``possible_1256``
(US-DCM perps / Kalshi), and ``gambling`` (sports). An entry with any other
bucket is rejected — tagging must be correct from trade one.

Pure + deterministic, no I/O. The Supabase schema is
``supabase/migrations/0003_pnl_schema.sql``; the row-sync and the digest
formatter (``digest.py``) are separate.
