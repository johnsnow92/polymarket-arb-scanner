"""Kalshi Liquidity Incentive Program (LIP) snapshot scoring.

Deterministic, pure scoring of resting limit orders under Kalshi's LIP rules
(https://help.kalshi.com/en/articles/13823851-liquidity-incentive-program).

Program mechanics implemented here:
  * Kalshi snapshots the book every second during trading hours.
  * Only resting size that helps reach the per-period Target Size qualifies.
  * Each qualifying order scores ``size * distance_multiplier`` where the
    multiplier is ``1.0`` at the same-side best price and decays by the
    Discount Factor for every tick away from it: ``discount_factor ** ticks``.
  * A participant's period score is the sum of its per-snapshot scores.
  * Reward = ``(your_score / total_market_score) * reward_pool``.

No network, no auth, no LLM — this is the deterministic scoring core that the
reward routines call. Kalshi exposes no per-snapshot scoring API, so this
mirrors the published formula to estimate accrual locally.
