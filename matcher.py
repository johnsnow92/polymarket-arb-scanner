"""Cross-platform market matcher using fuzzy string matching and optional embeddings.

Matches Polymarket binary markets against Kalshi events by title similarity.
Kalshi events have clean titles suitable for matching, while their markets
endpoint is dominated by sports parlay combos with unhelpful titles.

When fastembed is available and SEMANTIC_MATCHING_ENABLED is true, an
embedding-based matcher provides higher-recall cross-platform matching
using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 cosine similarity.

    """Embedding-based matching of Polymarket markets to Kalshi events.

    Semantic counterpart of ``match_markets_to_events()``.  Uses the same
    two-stage pipeline as ``match_cross_platform_semantic()`` —
    entity-overlap pre-filter followed by cosine similarity — but operates
    on PM markets vs Kalshi *events* rather than generic market lists.

    Falls back to fuzzy ``match_markets_to_events()`` if fastembed is
    unavailable.

    Args:
        polymarket_markets: List of Polymarket market dicts.
        kalshi_events: List of Kalshi event dicts (title/event_ticker).
        threshold: Minimum cosine similarity for a match (0-1).
        min_confidence: Minimum confidence tier (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW).

    Returns:
        List of matched pairs with keys ``polymarket``, ``kalshi_event``,
        ``similarity``, ``cosine_similarity``, ``entity_overlap``, and
