"""Earnings-mention NO-harvest OOS logger — the live weekly runner.

Weekly entry point for ``earnings_mention.py``: finds Kalshi company-KPI /
earnings-mention markets that have SETTLED since the last watermark,
reconstructs each one's YES price at T-24h before close via candlesticks,
accumulates the resolved history in a local JSON state file across runs,
recomputes the OOS richness stats + pre-registered verdict, and
Telegram-tickets the running verdict. Detection/logging only — this script
never places an order, never touches capital, and has no LLM in its path.
See docs/plans/08-earnings-mention-oos.md.

Redesign (2026-07-05): v1 tried to snapshot markets LIVE while they sat
inside their open [close-24h, close-6h] window, tracked as "pending" state
resolved on a later run. That approach cannot reliably catch a market whose
entire lifetime (open -> settle) falls between two weekly cron runs — a
real coverage gap. This version instead looks backwards from what has
ALREADY settled (client.fetch_settled_markets, watermark-bounded) and
reconstructs each one's T-24h price after the fact via candlesticks
(earnings_mention.price_at_t24h) — the same method the in-sample pilot used
(T1-pm-dispersion-novelty.md §a). There is no "pending" state as a result:
state is just a time watermark + a set of already-processed tickers + the
accumulated resolved history.

Fail-closed on partial failures, at two levels:
  - Per-ticker: a market whose candlestick fetch itself FAILS (network/HTTP
    error — signaled by a RuntimeError) is neither marked seen nor
    counted, and the watermark rolls back so it's retried next cycle. This
    is distinct from a market that has NO usable candle because it
    genuinely never traded in the T-24h window (e.g. its whole lifetime was
    shorter than the lookback) — earnings_mention.price_at_t24h returns
    None for that, a PERMANENT condition, so it's marked seen and excluded
    immediately rather than retried forever (both cases used to look
    identical — "returns None either way" — which permanently stuck a
    market that could never resolve in the retry queue).
  - Whole-cycle: kalshi_api.fetch_settled_markets raises
    RuntimeError rather than returning a silently-partial
    list if a page fails or the page budget is exhausted with more data
    available. main() treats that as a total cycle failure: no state
    change, no alert, try again next scheduled run.
Any per-ticker failure this cycle suppresses the normal verdict alert (a
partial-cycle verdict could be biased if the failures aren't random) in
favor of a distinct failure notice; state changes are still saved so
progress from tickers that DID resolve cleanly this cycle isn't lost.

State: v1 persists locally as JSON, restored across scheduled runs via
``actions/cache`` — the same convention scripts/run_edgar_scan.py uses for
its dedup state file. This intentionally does NOT write to the shared
Supabase ``pnl`` table: that table is realized P&L (see
scripts/run_pnl_digest.py), and this logger produces $0 statistical rows
that would corrupt its rollups. Spec step 6 gates "add Supabase secrets ->
activate weekly cron" as an explicit operator follow-up once a dedicated
table exists — not assumed here. actions/cache is this repo's only existing
cross-run state convention (no workflow here commits state back to git);
introducing an auto-push-to-master capability for a rolling state blob was
judged a materially bigger, riskier change than the problem warranted for a
~4-week campaign window, so instead: the workflow also uploads the state
file as a 90-day build artifact (human-recoverable backup, not part of the
automated restore path), and _check_state_anomaly gives a best-effort,
self-referential guard against a silent cache reset (see its docstring for
the one case it structurally cannot detect: a *total* cache wipe erases its
own reference point too).

Cron-safe at every missing-config boundary: no Kalshi creds, a failed
auth, or missing Telegram creds all log a warning and exit 0 rather than
raising.
